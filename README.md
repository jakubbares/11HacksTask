Dear senior developers,

I have prepared a trimmed down repository for you of both backend and frontend.

Your task is prepare a component displaying a shot chart heatmap with hexagon fields
The chart shows shots for a given match and team as a heatmap counting shots from each hexagon
(Don't worry about the explaining arrows you can see on the enclosed image) 

For frontend you will use Angular, d3
For backend flask and pandas (or ideally spark)

Steps:
1) You can you the enclosed code or you are free to use your own boilerplate project template for Angular and flask
2) Remove eveything from the project structure you dont need for the final chart and data processing
3) Extract functions that might be useful for similar projects into the functions files in src/app/functions

Backend task:
1) Parse the event data (contains only shots) and distinguish different types of shots and results
2) Transform the data and calculate the hexagon fields and count of shots for each
3) Create your own endpoint and call it from frontend
4) Clean the code (many small functions, readable variable names, etc.)

Frontend task:
1) Use the shot.chart.ts you have inside the code repo to understand the basics of d3
2) Extract special function Ã­n the visualization.functions.ts to display the hexagons
3) Combine the original shot chart component and this new function to produce the final result
4) Clean the code (many small functions, readable variable names, etc.)
